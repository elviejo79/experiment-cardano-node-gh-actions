# experiment-cardano-node-gh-actions
Trying to execute cardano node as part of github actions.

# Issue: First run is not enough to cache the status of the blockchain
so I created my owon fork of the action.
lowered the threshold to sync to 90%
will let it run.
once it actually caches something,
I'll go back and change it again.
